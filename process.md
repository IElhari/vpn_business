Pre-Engagement Checklist
Before diving into the technical steps, here's a list of things you should have ready:

Client Details: Obtain details about the client's network setup, such as:

Current network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, internet connection).
What systems need to be accessed remotely (e.g., pharmacy management software, inventory, POS systems).
Number of remote users (employees) and their roles (pharmacists, admin staff, etc.).
Any existing security tools they use (firewalls, antivirus, etc.).
Compliance Requirements: Verify that the solution you’re going to implement complies with HIPAA and any other local regulations regarding data protection in the healthcare industry.

VPN Preferences: Determine if the client has any preferences for the VPN technology. You’ll need to decide whether to use:

OpenVPN (open-source, highly customizable).
WireGuard (modern, fast, secure, and lightweight).
Proprietary VPNs (e.g., Cisco AnyConnect, Fortinet).
Step 1: Assess the Network & Infrastructure
Check Current Network Setup:

Verify the client’s router/firewall configuration. The VPN will need to pass through this equipment.
Check for any existing VPN setups (e.g., old VPN servers or software they were using).
Prepare for Remote Access:

Public IP: Ensure the client’s network has a static public IP (or use Dynamic DNS if they have a dynamic IP).
Internet Speed: Verify that the internet connection can handle remote traffic securely without throttling.
Network Segmentation:

Consider network segmentation. Separate internal resources (e.g., prescription databases, patient information) from other systems (e.g., email or non-sensitive data). This is especially crucial for HIPAA compliance.
You may need to create VLANs or use firewalls to control access based on user roles.
Step 2: Choose Your VPN Solution
For simplicity, let’s assume you are setting up OpenVPN for the pharmacy. OpenVPN is secure, customizable, and cost-effective. You’ll need to decide whether the VPN server is self-hosted or cloud-based.

Equipment:

Server: The VPN server will be hosted either on-premises (client's server) or on a cloud instance. It can run on a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu) or Windows Server.
Router/Firewall: Ensure port forwarding for the VPN (typically UDP 1194 for OpenVPN). You may need to configure NAT (Network Address Translation) if remote users will be connecting through the client’s router.
Required Tools:

OpenVPN software (or any other VPN software you’re using).
Access to the router/firewall for configuration.
Admin access to the server (Linux/Windows) to install and configure the VPN server.
A client device (Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS) to test the VPN connection.
Step 3: Set Up the VPN Server (OpenVPN Example)
Install OpenVPN on the Server:

Step 4: Configure the Router/Firewall
Port Forwarding:
Forward UDP port 1194 (default OpenVPN port) from the router to the server hosting the OpenVPN server. This allows remote clients to access the server.
Firewall Configuration:
Configure the firewall (on the router or the server) to allow traffic on port 1194 and ensure that the VPN traffic is not blocked.
Step 5: Set Up Client Devices
Install OpenVPN Client:

Install the OpenVPN client on the remote devices that will access the pharmacy network (e.g., laptop, tablet, smartphone). OpenVPN clients are available for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
Import Configuration Files:

Copy the client configuration file (usually client1.ovpn) to the client device. This file contains the connection details, including the server’s public IP, certificates, and keys.
Testing the Connection:

Test the connection from the remote client to the VPN server to ensure everything is set up correctly. Use OpenVPN’s client application to import the configuration and connect to the server.
Step 6: Test Security and Compliance
Verify Encryption:
Make sure that the VPN is using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) to secure data in transit.
Test Access Control:
Ensure that only authorized users can connect and access the pharmacy’s internal resources. You can enforce this by setting up user-specific configurations on the VPN server.
Check Logs:
Review VPN logs regularly for any suspicious activity or unauthorized connection attempts.
Step 7: Training and Documentation for the Client
Training the Pharmacy Team:
Walk the pharmacy owner and staff through the process of connecting to the VPN. Show them how to use the OpenVPN client and troubleshoot common issues (e.g., reconnecting, password issues).
Create Documentation:
Provide the client with a document explaining how to use the VPN, including step-by-step instructions for setup, troubleshooting, and contact information for support.
Step 8: Ongoing Maintenance & Monitoring
Monitor the VPN:

Set up monitoring tools to keep an eye on the VPN’s performance, uptime, and security. You can use OpenVPN’s logs or external tools like Zabbix or Nagios for this.
Security Updates:

Regularly update OpenVPN and related software packages to ensure the system is patched against the latest vulnerabilities.
Periodic Security Audits:

Offer your client periodic security audits to ensure that the VPN setup remains secure and compliant with HIPAA.
This walkthrough provides the core steps for setting up and managing a secure VPN for an independent pharmacy. You’ll want to adapt each step to the specific needs of your client, particularly around compliance requirements and the existing infrastructure they have in place.
